What Is Risk-Free Rate Of Return?
The risk-free rate of return is the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest an investor would expect from an absolutely risk-free investment over a specified period of time. The real risk-free rate can be calculated by subtracting the current inflation rate from the yield of the Treasury bond matching your investment duration.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

The risk-free rate of return refers to the theoretical rate of return of an investment with zero risk.

In practice, the risk-free rate of return does not truly exist, as every investment carries at least a small amount of risk.

To calculate the real risk-free rate, subtract the inflation rate from the yield of the Treasury bond matching your investment duration.
